scripts for Balter-Kennedy et al., Be-10 in pyroxene manuscript, to be submitted to Gchron in 2022


These MATLAB scripts were used to perform all of the calculations and generate figures associated with the manuscript "Cosmogenic 10Be in pyroxene: laboratory progress, production rate systematics, and application of the 10Be-3He nuclide pair in the Antarctic Dry Valleys", to be submitted to the journal Geochoron by Balter-Kennedy et al. in November 2022. This version includes the most up-to-date scripts, but the commenting is somewhat outdated and everything could be more organized. I hope to release a more user friendly set of scripts in the coming weeks.

One note is that in the manuscript, the surface samples have only numbers assigned. Here, those numbers are consistent with the manuscript, but include the prefix SULA-. I am keeping the SULA prefix here so that the sample names are interpreted as text. Also note that sample CPX-2 here is the same as sample NPX93*52.
